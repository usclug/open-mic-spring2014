##USCLUG::OpenMicNight(): An Open-Source Community Workshop

Interactive workshop where members of the USC community (you!) will have short 5-15 minutes to talk about anything open-source, programming or developer-related! We will also have free Virtual Private Servers from Digital Ocean!

**Droplets**: Launch and configure your own Digital Ocean VPS and control your web presence (w/ free DO codes!)

**TMUX**: You think browser tabs are cool? wait until you multiplex your terminal. Never lose a terminal session again and ssh like a pro.

**MPD+Icecast**: Make your own internet music streaming service

**Grap**: Describe your graphs, type-set them and include them in your document from the commandline.

**Docker**: Linux containers are all the rage. See how you can standardize your deployment using lightweight containers.
